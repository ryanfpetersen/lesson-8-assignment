A11y changes made to Archery site:

1. Increased text contrast
The Archery site style guide specifies a light blue text on white background for the
vertical instructor profile. However the contrast ratio for this is 2.87:1, which fails all
WCAG contrast levels. I changed the style to have dark grey text on a light grey background.
The contract ratio is 7.95:1, which passes all WCAG tests.

2. Added a hidden "Skip Text" link that allows user to skip the nav and go directly
to the main content.

2. Increased size and spacing of clickable elements
Nav and register buttons

3. Added labels to all form elements

4. Ensured that all headers are semantic

5. Added descriptive img alt text
